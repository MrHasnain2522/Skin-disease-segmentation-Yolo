# Project title:
  Skin diseas segmentation using yolo11.seg

# ðŸ§¬ Intro:
  Skin diseases are among the most common health issues globally, ranging from mild irritations to serious infections and cancers.
  Early and accurate detection is critical for effective treatment. However, diagnosis often requires expert dermatological knowledge,
  which may not always be accessible in under-resourced regions.

  This project aims to address that gap by leveraging YOLOv11 (You Only Look Once) â€” a state-of-the-art deep learning model â€” for real-time,
  skin disease segmentation and detection. The model is trained to both locate and segment skin lesions and abnormal patterns directly from medical images.
  Unlike traditional object detection methods that are slow and multi-staged, YOLO operates as a single-stage detector, making it fast and suitable,
  for real-time applications. In this project, YOLOv11 has been fine-tuned to identify areas of interest on the skin, such as moles, rashes, or lesions,
  and output both bounding boxes and pixel-level masks for those regions.
